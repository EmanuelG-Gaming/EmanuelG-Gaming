### ***Emanuel G or Antumbra***

### Basic information
JS and Java programmer. Mindustry modder for about a year and a half. Just see my pinned repositories for some fun ~~or eternal tormenting with Flares~~.

**Bonus:**
I develop a game noone cares about, named *Mindustrial Tycoon*. It's a Python/C++ game based off Mindustry.

~~The question is, why are you looking at this?~~
